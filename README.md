##Kaggle - Titanic
The file 'titanic.R' contains my most recently submitted code. 'workflow.R' is a sort of documentation of my thought process going into it. 

All code is based on a tutorial I read(http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r), but I wanted to keep my personal copy of it for reference.
